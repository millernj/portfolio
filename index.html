          I'm a full-stack software developer based in Santa Monica. My journey into this space essentially began
          with python which I utilized for data analysis in my research to get my undergraduate physics degree. 
          With python, I got a fairly basic introduction to core programming concepts like loops, functions, 
          version control, etc., and started to appreciate the seemingly limitless potential of software.

          Once I was out of school, I found work as a IT help desk / data analyst contractor at Cypress Creek Renewables 
          (CCR) which, after my ambition for programming garnered the attention of the software development team, 
          transitioned quickly into a junior, full-stack developer job. At CCR, I've gotten into a little bit of everything:
          AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap, React-redux, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, AWS Lambdas, and s3.
        </p>

          I'm currently furthering my education in the software engineering space through the UCLA Extensions 
          full-stack web development bootcamp.
